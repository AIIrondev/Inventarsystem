# Image Upload System Update: Unique Non-Reusable Filenames

## Overview
We have updated the image upload system to implement completely unique, non-reusable filenames for all uploaded images in the Inventarsystem.

## Changes Made

### 1. UUID-based Image Filenames
- All uploaded images now receive a UUID-based filename that is guaranteed to be unique
- The naming format is `{uuid}_{timestamp}{extension}`, ensuring uniqueness even across concurrent uploads
- This prevents any possibility of filename collisions or accidental overwriting

### 2. Book Cover Image Filenames
- Book covers downloaded from external sources now use full UUIDs instead of truncated hash values
- This significantly reduces the possibility of collisions for book covers with similar names or sources

### 3. QR Code Filenames
- QR code generation now uses secure filenames that properly escape special characters
- This prevents issues with items that have unusual names containing special characters

## Benefits

### Security Improvements
- Prevents predictable filename attacks
- Eliminates the risk of accidental file overwriting
- Ensures each uploaded asset gets a unique path

### Reliability Improvements
- No more duplicate filenames even with concurrent uploads
- Eliminates race conditions in the upload process
- Preserves all historical uploads without overwriting

### Data Integrity
- Each item's images remain permanently associated with the correct item
- Prevents confusion from reused filenames
- Simplifies backup and restore operations

## Technical Implementation
- Used Python's built-in `uuid.uuid4()` function to generate universally unique identifiers
- Combined UUIDs with timestamps for additional uniqueness guarantee
- Applied this naming scheme consistently across all file upload operations

## Testing
The system has been tested with:
- Concurrent uploads
- Images with identical filenames
- Special characters in filenames
- Book cover downloads
- QR code generation

All tests confirm that the new system assigns truly unique, non-reusable filenames to all uploaded content.
